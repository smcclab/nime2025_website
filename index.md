## About NIME2025

**New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)**, is an international conference about new musical interfaces, their artistic use and the technologies involved in building them. Researchers from all over the world share their knowledge and late breaking work during the conference. The conference started as a workshop at the CHI conference in 2001 and, since then, has been held annually around the world.

**Canberra** is a small but culturally energetic city holding many of Australia’s cultural institutions. The ANU has a history of engagement with electronic and computer art and music through scholarship, artistic fellowships, and education. The ANU is active in addressing important social issues in Australia such as a commitment to below zero carbon usage and engagement with and celebration of First Nations people.

The theme of NIME2025 is _**­entangled NIME**_. This theme recognises the multilayered contexts of activity and impact involved in music making with new technology.

In addition to showcasing the best of international NIME-related research, scholarship and artistic investigation, NIME2025 will continue building a strong and inclusive scholarly computer music and art community in Australia. This is particularly important for supporting Australian and New Zealand researchers and artists who are young/emerging, historically disadvantaged, have a disability, are First Nations people or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.
